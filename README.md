## Look4How (B4J version)

***Look4How*** is a Knowledge Management Application to store & retrieve, from a database, information for a topic which is organized by themes with items, being categories and related memos. The items are sorted alphabetically.
Look4How has been developed for personal use but open to share the source code. 

The application is developed with [B4J](http://https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html).
For those interested, the B4J source code is included for Look4How (Look4How094.zip) and the Look4How uploader (Look4HowUploader102.zip) = a lot to explore (enjoy).

The B4JHowTo database is part of the master. Load into Look4How via File > Open.

***Note***
Status Dec 2018: This application is not developed further as decided to create a new version based on [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).
