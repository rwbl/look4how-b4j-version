## Look4How (B4J version)

***Look4How*** is a Knowledge Management Application to store & retrieve, from a database, information for a topic which is organized by themes with items, being categories and related memos. The items are sorted alphabetically.

The application is developed with [B4J](http://https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html).
For those interested, the B4J source code is included for Look4How and the Look4How uploader = a lot to explore.

The B4JHowTo database is not included (too large to attach) and can be requested via email.

### Get Started
Steps to install the Look4How Zip package for Windows (tested with Windows 10).
