## Look4How (B4J version)

***Look4How*** is a Knowledge Management Application to store & retrieve, from a database, information for a topic which is organized by themes with items, being categories and related memos. The items are sorted alphabetically.

The application is developed with [B4J](http://https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html).
For those interested, the B4J source code is included for Look4How (Look4How094.zip) and the Look4How uploader (Look4HowUploader102.zip) = a lot to explore (enjoy).

The B4JHowTo database is not included (too large to attach) and can be requested via email.

### Get Started
Steps to install the Look4How Zip package for Windows (tested with Windows 10). 
 
Unzip Look4How.zip to a folder of choice, i.e. Look4How.
Following files are extracted:
* Look4How.jar – Core application.
* Look4How.pdf – Help file.
* Look4HowUploader.jar – Tool to upload theme files.

Check if the Java Runtime Environment JRE is installed:
* This is a requirement to run Look4How.
* Recommended is Java 8. To check the installed Java version, run from the command line: java –version. Result like: java version "1.8.0_192".
* Start Look4How from the command line with command (Java must be on the path) java –jar look4how.jar or double click on the Windows Explorer with Look4How.jar selected.

While starting, Look4How creates additional files and the export folder.
The main screen appears, in full screen mode first time, with the status information, that no themes are defined for the default database “Look4How.l4h”.
